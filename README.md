Computer Organization - CSE112 Winter semester 2023 Project

Project Guidlines:

This project consists of 4 parts
1. Designing and Implementing the assembler.
2. Designing and Implementing the simulator.
3. Extending the functionality of the assembler-simulator set-up to handle simple floating-point computations.
4. Creating five new instructions and adjusting the assembler and simulator acoording to the new instructions.


A. ASSEMBLER

The assembler.py file consists of the code for theÂ assembler.
The assembler reads assembly program as an input text file and generates the binary as an output text file. 
In case of any error, the error is generated with the line number in which error has been encountered.

Add the path of the test case in the textfile list for getting the require "output.txt" files.
We have added some sample test cases to test the functioning of the code.
