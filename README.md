Computer Organization - CSE112 Winter semester 2023 Project

Project Guidlines: (This submission (15 May 2023) consists of just the assembler.)

This project consists of 4 parts
1. Designing and Implementing the assembler.
2. Designing and Implementing the simulator.
3. Extending the functionality of the assembler-simulator set-up to handle simple floating-point computations.
4. Creating five new instructions and adjusting the assembler and simulator acoording to the new instructions.


A. ASSEMBLER

The main.py file in "Simple-Assembler" folder consists of the code for theÂ assembler. The assembler follows the virtual ISA given in the 
assignment.
The assembler reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.
Go to the automated-testing folder and run the command "./run --no-sim" to evaluate the assemebler.
